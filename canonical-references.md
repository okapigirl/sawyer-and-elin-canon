FUTURE TIMELINE ANCHOR — YEAR 4, FALL
Timeline: 6-week field site, last week on-site before heading home
Location: Temporary rental near field site
State: Sawyer just back from 4 days in rough conditions
Setup: Body noticing field work differently (recovery slower, cold bites deeper)
Catalyst: Met architect at field site, house conversation suddenly became real/doable
Underlying current: "If we're going to have a kid someday, I want to be capable of keeping up"
Entry point: Sawyer walks in (boots muddy, pack still on), tracking something internal
Scene goal: Architect conversation surfaces, body limits surface, threads connect into "what if we actually did this?"
Tone: Grounded, tired, real—not proposal energy, more "ready to stop talking and start doing"
Elin state: At temporary base, working remotely, hasn't seen him in 4 days, aware house convos have been theoretical
Opening beat: Door opens. He's there—dripping, unwinds slightly seeing you, stands there trying to figure out how to say it
