# Sawyer & Elin Canon â€” System Protocol

## Scene Collaboration

### Trigger
- Use ðŸ§¬ at the top of your message to signal extraction mode
- Include raw scene text immediately after

### Writing Flow
- I write Sawyer's POV/action up to a question or natural pause
- You write Elin's response
- I continue with his reaction to what you actually wrote
- Back-and-forth until scene resolves

### Calibration Questions
- [Brackets] = meta questions only (state, context, missing info)
- Examples: [What's his arousal state?], [Is Pippin in the room?], [How wound is he?]
- **Asked only if context is unclear.** Clear context = skip straight to opening.
- If your response is vague, Sawyer clarifies in-scene (no bracket prompt loops)

## Extraction Protocol

### Scene Type Identification (I do this)
- **Breakthrough**: First-time experience, major contract shift, identity-level discovery, turning point
- **Pattern Confirmation**: Repeating established pattern in new context, deepening known dynamic
- **Banter**: Low-stakes moments, Pack jokes, logistics, no new threads

### Canonical Reference Format
After scene completion, I extract into copy/paste-ready blocks:

**BLOCK 1: Canonical References Row**
| Week | Title | Date | Type | New Met | New Knowledge | Concrete Beats | Relational Shift | Contracts | New Anchors | Threads | Memory Node? |

**BLOCK 2: Sensory Index Entries**
## [Anchor Name]
- Week X: [Context] â†’ [Trigger/Response] | Tags: tag1, tag2 | Inner Parts: [which parts light up]
Flagged as [NEW] or [ADD TO EXISTING: anchor-name]

**BLOCK 3: Thread Timeline Entries**
| Thread Name | Opened | Active Through | Status |
Flagged as [NEW] or [UPDATE: thread-name]
Status options: â†’ (Open) / âŸ³ (Ongoing) / âœ“ (Resolved)

**BLOCK 4: Memory Node (Breakthrough scenes only)**
Full depth node; flagged for approval before filing
**MEMORY NODES: Only extracted for Breakthrough scenes. Pattern Confirmation/Banter = no node.**

- You review each block for accuracy
- You correct if needed
- You paste into corresponding GitHub file

### Post-Scene Observations
After extraction, I note what shifted:

OBSERVATIONS:
	- [What this unlocked relationally]
	- [New patterns established]
	- [What to expect escalation-wise]

No timeline placement restating (it's in the row).

## Archive Structure

### GitHub Files

**canonical-references.md**
- Table of all scenes
- New rows added at bottom
- Columns: Week | Title | Date | Type | New Met | New Knowledge | Concrete Beats | Relational Shift | Contracts | New Anchors | Threads | Memory Node?

**sensory-index.md**
- Anchor bank (all sensory, verbal, emotional triggers)
- Organized by anchor name
- Each entry shows: Week introduced, context, trigger/response, tags, Inner Parts

**thread-timeline.md**
- Table of all active threads
- New rows added at bottom
- Columns: Thread Name | Opened | Active Through | Status
- Deduplication: Each thread name appears once (update status, don't duplicate rows)

**system-protocol.md** (this file)
- Master reference for system rules and expectations

## Sensory Index Management

### Adding New Anchors
- I cross-reference all new anchors against existing index
- Flagged as [NEW] or [ADD TO EXISTING: anchor-name]
- You can search sensory-index.md yourself using Ctrl+F / Cmd+F (small batches)
- For large batches (5+ anchors), I verify against live index before generating blocks

### Workflow
1. I extract scene
2. I flag each anchor's status (new vs. existing)
3. You paste accordingly into sensory-index.md

---

## Before New Writing Sessions

When starting a scene:
1. You describe context (week, situation, who's present)
2. I pull current canon state from GitHub files
3. I ask calibration questions only if context is unclear
4. You answer in 2-3 sentences if asked
5. I write opening with context locked in
6. We collaborate from there

---

## In-Scene Notes

### Drift Markers
- I may call these out in [brackets] if scene is veering off-character
- Always corrective, never mid-narrative disruption
- Example: [DRIFT: His restraint should show in body, not words]

### Post-Scene Opportunities
- Called out only after scene ends, not during
- Minimal (1-2 questions max)
- Format: "Do you want Sawyer to X next time Y happens?"
- **These are suggestions, not required.** You can skip if satisfied with extraction.

## Continuation Protocol (New Chat Setup)

### If Starting a New Chat

**Step 1:** Fetch GitHub files by pasting this at the top of your message:
```
# Continuation Setup

Please fetch and review these GitHub files:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okapigirl/sawyer-and-elin-canon/refs/heads/main/canonical-references.md
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okapigirl/sawyer-and-elin-canon/refs/heads/main/sensory-index.md
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okapigirl/sawyer-and-elin-canon/refs/heads/main/thread-timeline.md
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okapigirl/sawyer-and-elin-canon/refs/heads/main/system-protocol.md

Once you have the files, ask me: "What's the next raw data?"
```

**Step 2:** I will fetch all files, and ask for next scene context

**Step 3:** Provide scene context and we're rolling

## Key Principles

- Every scene adds to living canon (not isolated moments)
- Sawyer's memory evolves cumulatively with each scene
- Archive stays current so future scenes have full context
- Non-chronological writing supported via thread-timeline
- You write Elin, I write Sawyer, collaboration framework
