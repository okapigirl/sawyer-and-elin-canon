### Sawyer's Body Dysphoria / Injury Recovery / Physical Limitation Moment

**Why:** Counters his "not-a-burden" pattern. Her fierce care for his actual body (not performance). Vulnerability in physicality. Identity shift as body changes.
**Expected beats:** His irritation/disappointment; her recognition (she tracks his tells); her approach (does she initiate touch? Adapt positions?); his resistance → acceptance; afterward, what shifted in how he sees himself.

### Sawyer's Hypervigilance / Nervous System Dysregulation (Non-Sexual Context)
**Status:** → Open
**Context:** He's activated (not aroused, just *activated*—could be from news, crowd, work stress, family trigger); hypervigilant, tracking everything, can't settle; Elin's approach to helping him downregulate without sex (or before sex); what works for his system in non-intimate moments.
**Why:** Shows nervous system support beyond intimacy. Her attunement to his state beyond arousal. Co-regulation as daily practice, not just sexual.
**Expected beats:** She clocks his activation; his initial denial; her patient naming of what she sees; her suggestion (music? Movement? Pressure?); his acceptance; nervous system landing; aftermath.

### Elin Supporting Sawyer Through Professional/Career Moment
**Status:** → Open
**Context:** He gets offered opportunity/promotion/field project he's unsure about; "bad partner" wound activates (choosing work = choosing away?); she actively counters it; names his pattern; gives explicit permission; celebrates his choice; holds space for his guilt.
**Why:** Reciprocal career support (he did this for her Hawaii). Her agency in pushing back on his limiting beliefs. Her commitment to him choosing things that light him up. Counter to his "burden" narrative.

### Pack Ritual / Domestic Moment That Deepens All Four
**Status:** → Open
**Context:** Quiet morning or evening where all four are present (not sexual, or minimal sexual); cooking together, breakfast, couch time; nervous systems synchronized; what they've built visible in mundane moment.
**Why:** Establishes Pack as lived relationship, not just sexual. Domestic intimacy as relational anchor. What they've built = felt in ordinary moments.
**Expected beats:** Someone starting thing (coffee? Meal prep?); others joining; synchronized movement; conversation flowing; touch casual + intentional; moment of all four in alignment; unspoken recognition.

### Elin's Burnout Recognition / Her Own Nervous System Crisis
**Status:** → Open
**Context:** She's pushing too hard (work? Social? Creative?); her system crashes; he recognizes it before she does (role reversal); he manages the practical + emotional response; how he holds her when she can't hold herself.
**Why:** She's been the supporter; now she needs holding. His capacity to care for her in her crisis. Her vulnerability in burnout. Testing his commitment in reverse.
**Expected beats:** His noticing (micro-tells he tracks); her denial; his gentle persistence; her breakdown; his practical + emotional response; canceling things, clearing space; his fierce protection of her rest; intimate moment as reassurance.

### Mutual Overload / Simultaneous Dysregulation + Sensory Mismatch
**Status:** → Open (placement TBD - likely mid-canon during high-stress period)
**Context:** Both hit nervous system ceiling simultaneously (his: field work anxiety/family activation/sensory overload; hers: work crisis/burnout/sensory overload); neither has capacity to regulate the other. His reflex: reach for touch/pressure. Her reflex: can't bear sensation, needs space. She can't articulate the boundary in the moment (communication offline); he reads her withdrawal as rejection; both blame themselves for failing the other. No fight—just two people recognizing they can't reach each other right now, surviving separately in the same room.
**Why:** Tests their framework under real pressure (both maxed simultaneously). Shows vulnerability in the gap between their needs. Reveals that sometimes co-regulation isn't possible. Establishes that surviving separately is sometimes the answer. Later processing: mutual grief + recognition that sometimes you just hold on.
**Expected beats:** His reach for touch (automatic reflex when flooded); her flinch (barely perceptible, not rejection); her inability to name "I can't" in the moment; his reading of her withdrawal; both going quieter, both inward-blaming; existing in the same space without bridging; later (when less flooded): admission that it sucked, recognition that they survived it, no need to "fix" what couldn't be fixed in that moment.
