## "You're Exactly My Speed"
- Week 1: Nervous system match recognition, chaos-care balance confirmed | Tags: nervous system match, compatibility, identity-level, validation | Inner Parts: All parts (recognized), Fifteen (arousal at being understood)
- Week 2: Couch mapping → confirmed through systemic interdependence revelation (they regulate same way) | Tags: nervous system match, mutual regulation, feedback loop | Inner Parts: All parts (affirmed), core identity (validated)

## Special Interest Collision (Ryan Reynolds/Deadpool/Underdogs/Animal Docs/Massage/Anatomy)

- Week 2: Couch mapping → massage certification + anatomy narration = foundational wiring match confirmed (not just preference compatibility, identity-level) | Tags: identity-level, special interest collision, wiring match, massage, anatomy | Inner Parts: Core identity (claimed), all parts (recognized as exactly matched)

## "Good Girl"
- Week 2: Discovery during couch mapping → she combusts, genuine response (not performing) | Tags: verbal trigger, arousal, validation, vulnerability | Inner Parts: Younger self (validated), Fifteen (arousal spike), all parts (seen/praised)

## "Good Fucking Girl"

## *Please* (from her)

## Biting (as Possession Frame)

## Systemic Interdependence (Foundational)
