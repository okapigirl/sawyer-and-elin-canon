**Context:** During Command Mode scene, she tests leaving (swings leg over his head); he doesn't chase; she stays + processes invisible-contract wound  
**Trigger/Response:** She tests if leaving is safe → his non-pursuit (confirming it is) → his words "But I'm not fucking chasing you" → invisible-contract wound surfaces + gets held  
**Significance:** Names core wound: people chase what they want (proof of love = pursuit); he's showing her: my non-chasing = proof of respect + trust, not abandonment; she chooses to stay through her own agency  
**Deployment:** When she's testing abandonment fears; when she's considering leaving; when pursuit-wound surfaces

**Trigger/Response:** Her placing his hand on breast during command phase → stimulation + his detailed feedback → her discovering it lands differently when she's in charge → becomes documented arousal anchor  
**Significance:** New sensory anchor discovered in context of her leadership; her agency changes how sensation lands; power-dynamic shift enables new arousal pathways  
**Deployment:** During scenes where she's in command; context-dependent (different in her-leading mode vs. his-leading mode); breast + her authority = synergistic

**Context:** Coined during family visit planning; Sawyer's term for feral, grounded sex in nature after managing family dynamics  
**Trigger/Response:** Post-family-activation energy builds → urge to reclaim feral space → outdoor sex planned as post-contact reset → "cryptid sex" becomes coded language for this specific reclamation  
**Significance:** Permission for feral escalation after nervous system management; nature + privacy + unfiltered intensity as nervous system reset (not separate from intimacy, just repositioned)  
**Deployment:** Post-family contact (expected setup Week 31 during visit); whenever nervous system activation requires feral reset; outdoor + private context preferred
