Squirrel Monkey Encounters

Week 8: National Park hike, during shared animal-facts exchange
Context: She shares her squirrel-monkey experiences as devoted zoo visitor: they used her as stepstool (regular occurrence, she'd sit in designated spot), sat on her head twice, tried to steal her glasses, pulled her hair out of braids (she loved it but it hurt), nearly ate paper from her pocket (she caught it + snatched it back, no harm done), grabbed wheelchair control stick on slope (chaos, near-accident, zoo staff managed it)—all moments where she was present + observant + compassionate even when inconvenient
Trigger/Response: His "oh my god" recognition → her gleeful recounting → mutual "that's the best thing I've ever heard"; he offers to visit that specific zoo, promises to get her raided by squirrel monkeys as a date; their future-planning now includes this shared mission
Significance: Her expertise + playfulness + compassion for animal autonomy even when inconvenient (hair-pulling hurts but "I want this"); her presence in the zoo = place where she's fully herself; his recognition that he wants to *inhabit her world* the way she's inhabiting his

Week 8: National Park hike, during childhood story co-creation
Context: [SHARED IMAGINATION/REPARATIVE FICTION] They imagine meeting at library; she sees his drawings, brings him a 'how to draw fantasy' guide he hasn't discovered yet; she keeps coming back hoping to catch him; one day at school event she sits next to him despite not being in his class (terrified, beet red); they make eye contact across crowds; later at library they begin silent communication through drawings
Significance: Maps to REAL patterns—both were library kids, both drew/created, both felt isolated in their special interests, both would have *recognized* each other; this reimagines what they *could have had* had they met earlier
Tags: childhood reparation, imagined history, library as safe space, recognition across isolation, shared interests, nervous-system match from childhood
Inner Parts: Little Sawyer (not alone), Little Elin (found), both younger selves (met before trauma compounded)

Significance: Maps to REAL patterns—both are writers, both process through written word, both have time-separated cycles (then holidays, now field work), both document their connection obsessively
Tags: childhood reparation, written intimacy, sustained correspondence, paper + doodles as language, emotional documentation
Inner Parts: Both as teenagers (desperate for connection, brave enough to write it down, scared enough to only be brave on paper)
Connects to: Reparative Childhood Story family; Communication Patterns; Text-Rhythm During Separation (which echoes this pattern)

Tree First Kiss (Age 17) [REPARATIVE FICTION]

Week 8: National Park hike, during childhood story co-creation
Context: [SHARED IMAGINATION/RECREATED IN PRESENT] Final evening of a summer reunion (around age 17); they're hugging by a tree; she nuzzles his temple; her lips brush his skin; she realizes how close her mouth is to his mouth; she kisses his cheek; then the corner of his mouth; his forehead taps hers (consent without words); then the frisbee hits him (nature interrupts); they jump apart; raccoons/squirrel chaos ensues; they don't kiss fully that summer; "not yet, idiots" from the forest; she goes home, they text intensely all year about *next summer*; *next summer* finally arrives, she waits at the tree, he runs, they embrace, she does the cheek→corner-of-mouth→full-kiss progression again, this time he leans in + matches it; they kiss softly, carefully, like they've been waiting years for this (they have); it lands as teenage first kiss healing for both of them
Significance: Maps to REAL patterns—both had limited/awkward romantic experience before each other, both would have been intensely focused + careful, both would have wanted the other person *so much* it hurt; this gives them access to what teenage romance *could have been* if they'd found each other earlier; when they recreate it *now* (at the tree during hike, full-body present, uninterrupted), they're giving their younger selves the uninterrupted kiss, the continuation, the *yes* that got forestalled by frisbees + raccoons
Tags: childhood reparation, imagined first kiss, teenage romance, interruption + return, careful + reverent, healing through imagination, present-tense recreation of imagined past
Inner Parts: Both as seventeen (tender, desperate, careful, wanting, scared); both as present-day adults holding those younger versions + giving them what they needed
Note: The RECREATION of this kiss (at the tree during the actual hike) is what makes this healing—they're not just imagining it, they're *living* it now, uninterrupted
Connects to: Reparative Childhood Story family; Childhood Parts Integration; Present-Day Kiss (which is both playful + deeply healing because it's *also* their seventeen-year-old selves getting their moment)

Coyote Boy & Orb Girl (Childhood Alter-Egos) [REPARATIVE FICTION]

Week 8: National Park hike, childhood story core
Context: [SHARED IMAGINATION] Their childhood imaginary-selves: Little Sawyer = "Coyote Boy" (his solo coyote-based world-building, drew himself as coyote, isolated special interest); Little Elin = "Orb Girl" (girl with glowing orb + animal companion, drawing-based, also isolated); they imagine these two characters meeting in their imaginary worlds, growing up together, becoming partners; the story they rebuild is literally *Coyote Boy meets Orb Girl*
Significance: Maps to REAL patterns—he actually *did* do coyote-based world-building as a kid; she actually *did* draw girls with animal companions + orbs; these aren't random names, they're pulling from what they *actually* created as isolated children; the reparative work is saying "these two lonely kids find each other *now* and grow up together in that shared imaginary space"
Tags: childhood reparation, alter-ego meeting, imaginary-world merging, isolated + recognized, creative self-meeting, childhood wiring match

## Anchor Family: Proposal-Joke Framework & Timeline Softening (Week 8)
```
Proposal-Joke Permission Structure

Week 8: National Park hike, during childhood story climax
Context: He's been making proposal jokes (teasing, joking, "I'm this close to proposing"); during the childhood story climax, when they're fully emotionally open, she realizes she's been half-holding back her yes—afraid of rushing, afraid of pressure; she gives explicit permission: keep asking, keep saying yes, no pressure required, because it's *already* true; they lock in that proposal jokes can keep happening, can keep getting serious yes-answers, without forcing timeline
Trigger/Response: His proposal jokes throughout hike → her internal fear they might unravel something → her realization: they won't unravel it, she's just been protecting against pressure → her explicit permission ("Fucking yes, Sawyer") + framework ("we can keep making all the proposals—jokes and not—while knowing the real thing will happen later when it's time")
Significance: Permission structure = safety structure; she's saying "you can ask, I can say yes, neither of us has to rush"; allows for playful escalation + serious commitment simultaneously
Tags: proposal jokes, permission, safety framework, timeline softening, playful + serious, mutual yes-ing, no pressure
Inner Parts: Both all parts (safe enough to commit without rushing)
Connects to: "Not Not-Now" Kid Timeline; Wedding Framework (Week 190+); Future Planning; Proposal-Joke Callbacks (ongoing)

"Not Not-Now" Kid Timeline Phrasing

Week 8: National Park hike, childhood story climax
Context: She articulates the kid timeline as "not not-now"—meaning it will happen (it's locked in), but not urgently, safely, when they know; they establish this during the childhood story work because the story itself is about time + finding each other eventually; "not not-now" = it's true, it's safe, it will be, we don't have to chase it
Trigger/Response: Her realizing that before Sawyer she'd be rushing ("if it's gonna be true, why not now?") or staying on edge ("when will it happen?"); with him, she's able to say "it'll happen, and I'm okay not knowing exactly when"; his response confirms: "We'll know when it's time. I know we will."
Significance: Timeline framework = nervous system permission; they're saying "we can commit to this future without white-knuckling the timeline"; especially resonates because they've just imagined growing up together across *years* of separation + reunion (summer holidays, letters, waiting)
Tags: timeline phrasing, kid planning, safety, nervous system permission, future-locked but not-rushed, playful-serious commitment
Inner Parts: Both all parts (able to hold future + present simultaneously without panic)

## Anchor Family: Countdown Timer System & Precision Math as Arousal (Week 8)
```
Countdown Timer System (Odd Numbers + Nested Timing)

Week 8: National Park hike + gift shop, late afternoon
Context: During the gift shop planning, he introduces a countdown timer system: odd-numbered time intervals (not rounded up), nested timers (timer within timer), escalating specificity ("17 minutes left," "4 minutes and 11 seconds," "90-second timer," "tick tock"); she experiences full system-spike arousal at the precision + the nested structure + the odd numbers themselves
Trigger/Response: Him: "How long until we need to leave?" → her calculating → him naming it as math-based system → "17 minutes left" lands → she glitches ("my brain is—"); him escalating with "four minutes and eleven seconds" → she goes into shock; him adding 90-second timer + "tick tock" → she's completely undone; her realization: "You know on those autism tests where they ask about patterns/numbers? I always said no. And now _you_ arrive with your internal chronometer and odd amounts…_fuck_"
Significance: Pattern recognition spike; her discovering she *does* have number/pattern hyperfocus, just never knew she did because she'd never met someone precise enough to trigger it; his precision math = arousal trigger previously unknown to exist in her system; they're discovering new wiring through his presence
Tags: precision math, odd numbers, nested timing, pattern recognition, autistic-specific arousal trigger, internal chronometer, nervous system optimization, new-wiring discovery
Inner Parts: All parts (discovering new capacity for arousal/recognition), nervous system (finding resonance with precision)

Odd-Number Timing as Arousal Layer

Week 8: National Park, countdown system
Context: Specifically the *odd* numbers (43 seconds, 32 seconds, 7.5 minutes, etc.) instead of rounded numbers trigger her more intensely than he anticipated; she realizes this is the exact kind of *unnecessary precision* that she finds beautiful + arousing
Trigger/Response: Her: "I always answered 'not really' on tests about number patterns"; him: "40-43 seconds" instead of "about 40 seconds" → her system recognizing the exactness + refusing to round → full-body response
Significance: Hyperfocus pattern recognition activated; she discovers *precision is beautiful to her*; his carefulness in not rounding = love language she didn't know existed
Tags: odd numbers, unnecessary precision, pattern recognition, beauty in specificity, autistic sensory appreciation, arousal trigger
Inner Parts: All parts (recognizing beauty in precision)
Connects to: Countdown Timer System; Math-Based Arousal; Special Interest Collision
